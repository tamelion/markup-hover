# Markup Hover jQuery plugin
This plugin will visually highlight HTML elements generated by KSS (https://github.com/kneath/kss), which have had the displayed HTML code parsed and tagged by highlight.js (https://highlightjs.org/)

This will also work for manually created HTML elements, as long as the sample code has been parsed by highlight.js.

## Example plugin call
$('.hljs-tag').markupHover();

All options are annotated within the source.
